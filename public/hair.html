                has had clippers in his hands since he was 14 years old, and has been cutting professionally for 10 years.

                        Having her clients feel beautiful and confident is one of the main reasons why she enjoys what she does. 
                        She enjoys her clients leaving with nothing but confidence in themselves, and respects the relationships 
                        that she builds inside and outside of the chair.

                        The pressures to compromise her craft where real.  She had to deal with clients not being happy with the prices of her services. 
                        By staying true to who she knows she is, and knowing her worth as a stylist kept her going strong.  
                        If her prices didn’t suite others, then that clientele wasn’t what she was interested in.

                        has been a barber for 10 years, and the quality he delivers reflects that. 
                        It makes him feel good after seeing the reaction of his clients when they’re oversastisfied with his services! 
                        Seeing their increased confidence in his abilities has made his passion for barbering and grooming blossom. 
                        The recognition and satisfaction he gets from his clients is what makes him want to go even harder.

                        He’s always trying to take his abilities to the <u>next level</u>. 
                        He comes from a family of Haitian entrepreneurs, so his influences come from a deep-rooted 
                        culture of strong people; his grandfather, his father, and mother.
                        <br>
                        A major influence in his success is his barber brother, 
                        Haven Hobbs, who has taught him a lot about industry business. 
                        In regard to being pressured to compromise his craft, he ‘s humble enough to put the best of him and everything 
                        he does, his work and how he carries himself.

                         has had clippers in his hands since he was 14 years old, and has been cutting professionally for 10 years. 
                        The satisfaction of the clients’ faces after he cuts their hair, not to mention the recognition the 
                        clients get once they leave the shop makes Bryan’s work worthwhile. Bryan states  when a client 
                        comes back and tells him he’s had all luck with the ladies, or <i>“my girl loved my cut!”</i>, is just as rewarding.

                      Bryan believes there is no hairstyle he cannot cut.
